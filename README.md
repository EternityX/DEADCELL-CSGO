## Preface
Full CS:GO project files for [deadcell.cc](https://deadcell.cc/), for the OSHGui project, please see the [OSHGui repository](https://github.com/EternityX/DEADCELL-OSHGUI).

This is *not* a ready-to-use cheat, it is missing a lot of core features and has a multitude of issues. As such it is highly recommended that you do not use this if you have no prior programming knowledge. However we are working towards a stable, free, feature-rich cheat for everyone to use!

If you want a clean base without any features, please see the [deadcell SDK](https://github.com/alpine971/DEADCELL-SDK).

## FAQ
### Where's the DLL?
Build it yourself. We will not provide a binary.

### How do I add a hitmarker sound?
Create a **hitsounds** folder inside the **base** Counter-Strike Global Offensive directory.
Place as many **.wav** sound files as you want inside of it. Load the cheat and they will be under the hitsounds combobox.

### Where are config files stored?
Profiles are stored inside the **base** Counter-Strike Global Offensive directory under a folder named **profiles**.

You can share profiles with friends by navigating to the configuration tab inside the cheat and selecting **Export**. This will copy all profile data to the clipboard which you can then paste to a friend.

To import a profile, just copy all of the profile data and press **Import**. Make sure to save your profile by entering a name and pressing **Save**.

### Why does "Generating code..." take forever when building the project?
Most likely an issue with Visual Studio 2017, you can wait it out or use Visual Studio 2019 instead.

### Why does the ESP flicker?
Disable multi-core rendering in your CS:GO video settings.

### Why does moving the menu crash the game?
Disable multi-core rendering in your CS:GO video settings.

### How do I open the menu?
Press `INSERT`.

### How do I unload the cheat?
Press `END`.
